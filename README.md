# Lambda School - Data Science 9
### Build 1

This is my first project for Lambda School's monthly build week. I think media in general has people concerned over what might kill them, but that death in general is not nearly as likely as they believe. I'm using data gathered from the CDC on deaths in California to give a clear view on death, it's general probability against the surviving population, and it's most common causes. I believe the most likely causes of death are cardiac arrest and motor-vehicle collision, while a lot of people worry of terrorism and homicide via firearms. I intend to show whether or not either view is correct.
