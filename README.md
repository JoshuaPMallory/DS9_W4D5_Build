# Death and Statistics
### Lambda School - Data Science 9

From my corner of the world in California I think the media presents a hostile view of life; that shootings are happening more frequently than ever, that we're being manipulated by politicians and corporations, and that an excess diet of [eggs](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-with-eggs 'Physicians Committee: Health Concerns with Eggs') is going to give us cancer. Or, wait... [I guess they're good for you now](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/i-have-cancer-what-should-i-eat-2/ 'Cleveland Clinic: I Have Cancer — What Should I Eat?'). It sounds like [other countries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/06/04/china-warns-against-traveling-us-citing-shootings-robberies-theft/ 'Washington Post: China warns against traveling to the U.S., citing \‘shootings, robberies and theft\’') are taking note as well. So...

**Is there anything about death in recent years that we should actually be worried about?**

I don't think death is nearly as common or likely as they believe so I'm going to be look at death statistics in this post to give a general idea of the state of things in the past 17 years. By using data gathered from the CDC on California deaths I intend to give a clear view on death, it's most commonly talked about causes, and it's general probability against the surviving population. From what I've read in the past I believe the most likely causes of death are heart related illness and motor-vehicle collisions, and I'll compare that with what I believe most people would worry about; homicide and terrorism. (Well, I would do terrorism, but there's actually no listed deaths for terrorism in California, so that makes a great start!)

I intend to show whether or not either view is correct.
